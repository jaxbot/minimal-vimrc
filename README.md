# Minimal Vimrc

A somewhat minimal, somewhat boilerplate, vimrc for people who want something they can easily build on without having to spend hours and hours researching like I did.

It's commented pretty well.

To use it, download it as a zip, or git clone it. Put the .vim folder at ~/.vim on Linux/OSX, or C:\Users\You\vimfiles on Windows.

Contains the following goodies:
* [Tim Pope's Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for installing plugins easily
* [Nanotech's jellybeans theme](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim)

Gratitude goes to both of those authors, who make my daily life somewhat better.
